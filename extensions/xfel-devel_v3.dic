save__reflns.pdbx_CC_method
    _item_description.description
;             Method for selecting half datasets used in computing CC1/2 and CCstar

              The following enumerated values are used:

              by_observation: unmerged reflection intensities are randomly divided into
	        two half-sets. In the case of multi-crystal experiments, measurements from each
		crystal will be randomly sorted into the two half-sets prior to merging the
		half-sets.

                Recommendation from Karplus PA, Diederichs K. Linking crystallographic model and
	        data quality. Science. 2012;336(6084):1030-1033.

              by_lattice: crystals are pre-sorted into two half datasets of nearly equal size
	        (such as by odd vs. even crystal number).

    is a set of contiguous unit cells assumed to be perfectly aligned. Lower
    mosaicity indicates better ordered crystals.  See for example:
